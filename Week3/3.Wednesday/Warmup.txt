Imagine you are tracking the scores of the Lion's football matches in a season. Write a Java program to calculate the total number of goals scored and the average number of goals per match for the team. 
Create an integer array called matchGoals that represents the number of goals scored in each match throughout the season. 
Here is a list of the total score the Lions won in each game this season: 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2
Calculate and print both the total number of goals scored and the average number of goals per match.
