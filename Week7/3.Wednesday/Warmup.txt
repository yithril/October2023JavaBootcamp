Objective: Learn how to use generics by creating a generic container class that can hold and retrieve an object of any type.

    Generic Class Creation:
        Create a generic class named Container<T>. Here, T is a placeholder for the type that the Container will hold.
        Inside the class, have a private variable of type T to store the object.
        Provide a constructor to initialize the container with an object of type T.
        Include get() and set(T item) methods to retrieve and update the object in the container.

    Method Implementation:
        The set(T item) method should set the internal variable to item.
        The get() method should return the stored item.

    Testing with Different Types:
        In the main method, create instances of Container for different types, such as Integer, String, and maybe a custom class like Book.
        Use the set and get methods to store and retrieve objects from these containers.
        Print out the results to ensure the container is working with different types.

    Optional Challenge - Adding a Generic Method:
        Add a generic static method in the Container class, like static <U> void printContainer(Container<U> container), which prints the contents of any Container.
