Objective: Learn the basics of Java interfaces by creating and implementing a Device interface.

    Define an Interface:
        Create an interface named Device with two methods: turnOn() and turnOff().
        These methods should not take any parameters and should return nothing (void).

    Implement the Interface:
        Create two classes, Smartphone and Laptop, that implement the Device interface.
        In each class, provide an implementation for the turnOn() and turnOff() methods.
        For instance, in the Smartphone class, turnOn() could print "Smartphone is turning on" and turnOff() 
	could print "Smartphone is shutting down".

    Create a Main Method to Test:
        Write a simple main method where you instantiate a Smartphone and a Laptop.
        Call their turnOn and turnOff methods to test if they behave as expected.
