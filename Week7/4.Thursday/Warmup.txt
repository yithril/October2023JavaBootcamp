Objective: Learn to use Java Streams to process a collection of objects.

    Mock Data Creation:
        Create a class named Employee with properties like id, name, and salary.
        In your main method, create a List<Employee> and populate it with several Employee objects.

List<Employee> employees = Arrays.asList(
    new Employee(1, "Alice", 70000),
    new Employee(2, "Bob", 80000),
    new Employee(3, "Charlie", 90000),
    new Employee(4, "Diana", 75000),
    new Employee(5, "Evan", 88000)
);

Stream Operations:

    Filtering: Use a stream to filter out employees with a salary greater than 80k.
    Mapping: Convert the stream of employees to a stream of their names.
    Sorting: Sort the employees by their salary.
    Collecting: Collect the results into a new list and print it out.

Putting it Together:

    Create a method in your main class to perform these operations and return the processed list.

Testing:

    Call the method from your main method and print the results to verify if the stream operations are working as expected.
