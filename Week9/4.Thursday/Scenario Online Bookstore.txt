Scenario: Online Bookstore
Description:

Imagine you are developing a system for an online bookstore. The bookstore has a variety of books, each with unique attributes. 
Customers can place orders for these books. Each order can contain multiple books, but each book can belong to only one order at a time.

Step 1: Write Java classes to model this situation.

You will need a Book class, an Order class, and a Customer class. Please implement these classes in a Java project.
Discuss with your group what properties the classes should have (name, date, order#, etc.)

-Each class needs to have at least 4 properties.
-You will need to consider the relationships between them. (Think back to the IS-A and HAS-A relationships we learned in weeks previous)

Step 2. Design SQL tables

Next, create SQL tables for each of the Java classes. You should write all the sql queries in one file.
Think on how to best represent the Java data type in SQL. 

Tips:

-Java classes are written in singular form (typically)
-The name of the table needs to be the plural form of the class. For example, if the Java class is Car then the table should be named Cars.
-The column names should be exactly the same as the properties in the Java class (case sensitive)
-You will need to consider how to represent things like strings and floating point numbers in SQL.
-Create foreign keys as is necessary.
