        //If the player wants a card, deal them a card
        //Check to see if the player is over 21, if so, they lose
        //If the player is under 21, ask them again if they want to hit or stay

        //Repeat this process for all players

        //After all players have made their decision, it will be the dealers turn
            //If the dealer has 21, he will reveal his cards and play will end
            //If the dealer's current value is 17 or below, the dealer will hit and get a new card
            //If the dealer is above 17, they will stay.

        //Play ends, and the winner is determined.
            //Loop through all the players and the dealer
                //No need to loop through the dealer or players who already busted
            //Figure out who has the highest number up to and including 21
            //If two or more scores are the same, it's a tie

        //Ask the user if they'd like to play again
