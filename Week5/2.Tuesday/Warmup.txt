10/31 Warmup

Create an IntelliJ project for your warm up. We're going to create a way to look
up a movie's rating based on its name. We're going to use a hash map.

1. Create a hash map. The key will be the movie's name, the value will be the rating. 
   The rating will be a whole number from 1-10. Create the hash map accordingly.

2. Add 10 movies to your hash map with your own ratings. If you want to add more go ahead.

3. Look up the rating of a movie by its title and display it.

4. Check if a movie is in the hashmap or not. Display the result.

5. Print to the screen the name of all the movies with a rating of above 5.
