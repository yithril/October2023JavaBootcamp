Your mission, should you choose to accept it:

We're doing the end of week project in two parts. We're going to do the models and the repositories first.
Later we will do the controller and actually create an honest to goodness API.

Today, you need to do the following things:

1. Finish the Vehicle repository. I have already stubbed all the methods that you need.
   You can look in the classroom github repo to see what's already done.

2. Bring the dealership from your old project into the new project. You will need to adjust it.
   For example, we don't need all those extra methods, we just need the basic getters and setters for
   the dealership.

3. You will need to create a dealership repository. This repository will be able to do all CRUD functions
   for a dealership. 

4. This is NOT a console app, so there is nothing to type in, no menus, none of that stuff. To test to see
   if you are correct, you need to make a unit test. There is an example in the class github repo.
