1. Create a New Spring Boot Project:

    Use Spring Initializr.
    Include dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL database driver.

2. Pretend we're making an api for a bookstore. Define and Create the Following Entities:
	
    Author: id, name (not nullable)
    Book: id, title (not nullable, no longer than 40 characters), publish_date (not nullable), likes (int), price, genre 
        *For genre, create an enum called Genre (FICTION, SCIENCE_FICTION, etc...) and look up how to 
         correctly annotate an enum so it works with Spring Data JPA
    Publisher: id, name (not nullable), country (not nullable)

3. Be sure to set up the application.properties can correctly connect to your database.

4. Run your program and watch your tables get made!

BONUS: Under normal circumstances we could connect these tables with foreign keys. We'll learn how to do that today, but first
       think about the relationship between Books, Authors, and Publishers.
